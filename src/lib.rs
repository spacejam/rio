//! A steamy river of uring. Fast IO using io_uring.
//!
//! io_uring is going to change everything. It will speed up your
//! disk usage by like 300%. Go ahead, run the `O_DIRECT` example
//! and compare that to using a threadpool or anything
//! you want. It's not gonna come close!
//!
//! Starting in linux 5.5, it also has support for tcp accept.
//! This is gonna shred everything out there!!!
//!
//! But there's a few snags. Mainly, it's a little misuse-prone.
//! But Rust is pretty nice for specifying proofs about
//! memory usage in the type system. And we don't even have
//! to get too squirley. Check out the `write_at` implementation,
//! for example. It just says that the Completion, the underlying
//! uring, the file being used, the buffer being used, etc...
//! will all be in scope at the same time while the Completion
//! is in-use.
//!
//! Most of the other io_uring libraries make
//! it really easy to blow your legs off with
//! use-after-frees. `rio` uses standard Rust
//! lifetime specification  to make most use-after-frees
//! fail to compile. Also, if a `Completion`
//! that was pinned to the lifetime of a uring
//! and backing buffer is dropped, it
//! waits for its backing operation to complete
//! before returning from Drop, to further
//! prevent use-after-frees. use-after-frees
//! are difficult to express when using `rio`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This won't compile:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! let rio = rio::new().unwrap();
//! let file = std::fs::File::open("use_after_free").unwrap();
//! let out_buf = vec![42; 666];
//!
//! let completion = rio.write_at(&file, &out_buf, 0).unwrap();
//!
//! // At this very moment, the kernel has a pointer to that there slice.
//! // It also has the raw file descriptor of the file.
//! // It's fixin' to write the data from that memory into the file.
//! // But if we freed it, it would be a bug,
//! // and the kernel would write potentially scandalous data
//! // into the file instead.
//!
//! // any of the next 3 lines would cause compilation to fail...
//! drop(out_io_slice);
//! drop(file);
//! drop(rio);
//!
//! // this is both a Future and a normal blocking promise thing.
//! // If you're using async, just call `.await` on it instead
//! // of `.wait()`
//! completion.wait();
//!
//! // now it's safe to drop those things in any order.
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Really shines with O_DIRECT:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::{
//!     fs::OpenOptions,
//!     io::{IoSlice, Result},
//!     os::unix::fs::OpenOptionsExt,
//! };
//!
//! const CHUNK_SIZE: u64 = 4096 * 256;
//!
//! // `O_DIRECT` requires all reads and writes
//! // to be aligned to the block device's block
//! // size. 4096 might not be the best, or even
//! // a valid one, for yours!
//! #[repr(align(4096))]
//! struct Aligned([u8; CHUNK_SIZE as usize]);
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // start the ring
//!     let ring = rio::new().expect("create uring");
//!
//!     // open output file, with `O_DIRECT` set
//!     let file = OpenOptions::new()
//!         .read(true)
//!         .write(true)
//!         .create(true)
//!         .truncate(true)
//!         .custom_flags(libc::O_DIRECT)
//!         .open("file")
//!         .expect("open file");
//!
//!     // create output buffer
//!     let out_buf = Aligned([42; CHUNK_SIZE as usize]);
//!     let out_slice = out_buf.0.as_ref();
//!
//!     let mut completions = vec![];
//!
//!     for i in 0..(4 * 1024) {
//!         let at = i * CHUNK_SIZE;
//!
//!         let completion = ring.write_at(
//!             &file,
//!             &out_slice,
//!             at,
//!         );
//!         completions.push(completion);
//!     }
//!
//!     for completion in completions.into_iter() {
//!         completion.wait()?;
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
